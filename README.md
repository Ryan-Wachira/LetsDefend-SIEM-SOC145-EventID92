## **Investigation Process**  

### **1. Initial Alert and File Source**  
The file `ab.exe` was identified as the suspicious object. Upon investigation:  
- The file was downloaded from a ZIP archive.  
- It was originally named `ab.bin`.  
- After extracting the ZIP file, renaming `ab.bin` to `ab.exe` allowed the executable to run, triggering malicious activity.  

---

### **2. Log Management Analysis**  
We searched for network logs around the time of the alert to check for any external communication, such as Command-and-Control (C2) activity.  
- **Observation:** No suspicious network activity or logs correlated with the file's execution were found.  

This suggests that while the ransomware executed locally, it may not have attempted to contact a remote server.

### **3. Endpoint Analysis**  

#### **Endpoint Information**  
Details of the infected endpoint:  
- **Hostname:** MarkPRD  
- **Domain:** LetsDefend  
- **Primary User:** MarkGuna  
- **OS:** Windows 10 (64-bit)  
- **Last Login:** Aug 29, 2020, 08:12 PM  

The endpoint was analyzed for any changes or suspicious behavior.

#### **Process History**  
The endpointâ€™s process history revealed:  
- Execution of `ab.exe`, leading to the spawning of several processes like `rundll32.exe` and `ShadowCopy.exe`.  
- Disabling of **shadow copy** and recovery settings (a common tactic used by ransomware to prevent file recovery).

### **4. File Analysis**  

#### **a. VirusTotal**  
The file hash (`0b486fe0503524cfe4726a4022fa6a68`) was analyzed on **VirusTotal**.  
- Most security vendors flagged it as ransomware.

#### **b. Hybrid Analysis**  
Analysis on **Hybrid Analysis** revealed the following behaviors:  
- Deletion of volume snapshots (often used by ransomware).  
- Spawning multiple processes to maintain persistence.  
- Modifying files, including ransom notes.

#### **c. Any.Run Sandbox Analysis**  
The file was executed in the **Any.Run** sandbox, where detailed behaviors were observed:  
- `ab.exe` initiated processes such as `rundll32.exe` and `ShadowCopy.exe`.  
- Brief instances of PowerShell execution were noted.  
- A ransom note file (`UZIZ8_readme_text`) was created, warning that files were encrypted.

## **Conclusion**  
This investigation confirms the alert as a **true positive** for ransomware activity.  
- The malicious file `ab.exe` successfully executed, disabled recovery features, and encrypted files.  
- Ransomware behaviors were corroborated by sandbox and antivirus tools.  

No network communication was observed in logs, suggesting that the ransomware was primarily focused on local damage.

## **Artifacts and Observations**  

| **Artifact**                     | **Type**       | **Description**                                |
|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `0b486fe0503524cfe4726a4022fa6a68` | File Hash      | Flagged by multiple antivirus tools.           |
| `UZIZ8_readme_text`              | Ransom Note    | File created by the ransomware post-execution. |
| `ShadowCopy.exe`                 | Process        | Abused to disable recovery settings.           |
| `ab.bin`                         | Original File  | Renamed to `ab.exe` to trigger execution.      |

## **Next Steps**  
### Recommendations:  
1. **Containment:** Isolate the affected machine (`MarkPRD`) from the network to prevent potential spread.  
2. **Eradication:** Remove the ransomware and inspect other devices for signs of compromise.  
3. **Recovery:** Restore files from a secure backup.  
4. **Prevention:**  
   - Educate users on avoiding suspicious files.  
   - Implement stricter email and file download policies.
